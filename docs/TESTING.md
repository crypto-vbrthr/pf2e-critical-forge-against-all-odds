# Testing

Run:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run quality:check
```

The test suite covers:

- all four theme metrics and threshold boundaries;
- zero-HP exclusion for Bloodied Triumphs;
- missing battlefield data;
- save and attack roll-kind resolution;
- additive Narrow Escape evidence;
- context delegation to `core-pf2e`;
- immutable report enrichment;
- typed and unique Condition Provider fields;
- serializable Diagnostic Provider output;
- four packs and sixteen specialized deck slots;
- enabled-state mapping;
- extension-contract registration;
- capability rejection;
- owned-resource rollback;
- atomic pack refresh;
- settings registration and clamping;
- version metadata and localization parity.

During development, the pack and provider definitions are additionally smoke-tested against the actual Critical Forge `1.0.0-rc` registries. The Foundry smoke test remains necessary because Foundry hook timing, world settings, protected editor rendering, and live diagnostic presentation cannot be reproduced completely by Node tests.
