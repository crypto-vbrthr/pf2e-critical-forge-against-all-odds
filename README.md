# PF2E Critical Forge: Against All Odds

**Against All Odds** is an optional context-sensitive card expansion for **PF2E Critical Forge**. It contributes four thematic packs, each with separate Attack, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will decks:

- Bloodied Triumphs
- Surrounded, Still Standing
- Giant-Slayer Moments
- Narrow Escapes

Version `0.1.0-dev.15` keeps **Bloodied Triumphs** complete at 120 cards and completes the first ten-card pass across all four **Surrounded, Still Standing** decks, bringing that theme to 40 cards. All four published Surrounded decks use the live battlefield threat evaluation; selected stronger results additionally require three or four threatening enemies.

> **Development-package rename:** Remove any earlier `pf2e-against-all-odds` folder before installing this build. The canonical module ID is now `pf2e-critical-forge-against-all-odds`.


## Manual installation

After extraction, the manifest must be located exactly here:

```text
{Foundry user data}/Data/modules/pf2e-critical-forge-against-all-odds/module.json
```

The Foundry manifest requires PF2E Critical Forge `1.0.0-rc` or newer. At world start, the extension contract additionally verifies API version, schemas, battlefield-threat support, and all other required capabilities.

## Requirements

- Foundry VTT 14
- Pathfinder Second Edition 8.1.2 or newer
- PF2E Critical Forge `1.0.0-rc` or newer

## Current runtime fields

The add-on extends the Critical Forge snapshot below:

```text
extensions.againstAllOdds
```

It provides dynamic trigger results for:

- `bloodied.matched`
- `surrounded.matched`
- `giantSlayer.matched`
- `narrowEscape.matched`

All values and thresholds are visible through Diagnostics 2.0 and available in the visual Critical Card Editor.

## Compatibility

Against All Odds uses only the public Critical Forge extension contract. It does not patch Critical Forge internals or change Critical Card, Card Pack, Effect, or Diagnostic schemas.

## Current playable cards

Bloodied Triumphs is complete at 120 cards:

- thirty Attack-deck cards, split evenly between 15 ordinary and 15 spell critical hits;
- thirty Fortitude-deck cards for critically successful Fortitude saves;
- thirty Reflex-deck cards for critically successful Reflex saves;
- thirty Will-deck cards for critically successful Will saves;
- 108 automated Effect Engine cards;
- 12 explicit manual cards.

Surrounded, Still Standing now contains 40/120 cards:

- ten Attack-deck cards, split evenly between five ordinary and five spell critical hits;
- ten Fortitude-deck cards for critically successful Fortitude saves;
- ten Reflex-deck cards for critically successful Reflex saves;
- ten Will-deck cards for critically successful Will saves;
- each published Surrounded deck contains nine automated Effect Engine cards and one explicit manual tactical result;
- all forty require the live Surrounded trigger, while selected stronger cards additionally require three or four threatening enemies.

All three reviewed Bloodied ten-card passes are complete. The final pass deliberately adds fewer immunities and more context-sensitive results, including quarter-health, wounded, battlefield-threat, weapon damage-type, spell-trait, elemental-damage, fear, curse, auditory, linguistic, and incapacitation gates.

Every Bloodied Triumphs card requires `extensions.againstAllOdds.bloodied.matched == true`. Every published Surrounded card requires `extensions.againstAllOdds.surrounded.matched == true`. Attack cards remain isolated to `attack`; the Fortitude, Reflex, and Will cards remain isolated to their matching specialized deck and require the corresponding save filter. Stronger Surrounded results can additionally inspect `extensions.againstAllOdds.surrounded.count`.
