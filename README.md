# PF2E Critical Forge: Against All Odds

**Against All Odds** is an optional context-sensitive card expansion for **PF2E Critical Forge**. It contributes four thematic packs, each with separate Attack, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will decks:

- Bloodied Triumphs
- Surrounded, Still Standing
- Giant-Slayer Moments
- Narrow Escapes

Version `0.1.0-dev.2` is the add-on foundation. It registers the extension contract, runtime context provider, visual Card Editor fields, diagnostic evidence, world settings, and all sixteen planned deck slots. It intentionally contains no playable cards yet. Card content will be added in reviewed batches after the runtime triggers have been smoke-tested in Foundry.

> **Development-package rename:** Remove any earlier `pf2e-against-all-odds` folder before installing this build. The canonical module ID is now `pf2e-critical-forge-against-all-odds`.


## Manual installation

After extraction, the manifest must be located exactly here:

```text
{Foundry user data}/Data/modules/pf2e-critical-forge-against-all-odds/module.json
```

The Foundry manifest requires PF2E Critical Forge `1.0.0-rc` or newer. At world start, the extension contract additionally verifies API version, schemas, battlefield-threat support, and all other required capabilities.

## Requirements

- Foundry VTT 14
- Pathfinder Second Edition 8.1.2 or newer
- PF2E Critical Forge `1.0.0-rc` or newer

## Current runtime fields

The add-on extends the Critical Forge snapshot below:

```text
extensions.againstAllOdds
```

It provides dynamic trigger results for:

- `bloodied.matched`
- `surrounded.matched`
- `giantSlayer.matched`
- `narrowEscape.matched`

All values and thresholds are visible through Diagnostics 2.0 and available in the visual Critical Card Editor.

## Compatibility

Against All Odds uses only the public Critical Forge extension contract. It does not patch Critical Forge internals or change Critical Card, Card Pack, Effect, or Diagnostic schemas.
