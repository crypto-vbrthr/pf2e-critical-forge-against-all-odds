# PF2E Critical Forge: Against All Odds

**Against All Odds** is an optional context-sensitive card expansion for **PF2E Critical Forge**. It contributes four thematic packs, each with separate Attack, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will decks:

- Bloodied Triumphs
- Surrounded, Still Standing
- Giant-Slayer Moments
- Narrow Escapes

Version `0.1.0-dev.6` completes the first ten-card pass across all four Bloodied Triumphs decks by adding ten Will cards. Bloodied Triumphs now contains 40 of its planned 120 cards; each deck will ultimately contain 30 reviewed cards.

> **Development-package rename:** Remove any earlier `pf2e-against-all-odds` folder before installing this build. The canonical module ID is now `pf2e-critical-forge-against-all-odds`.


## Manual installation

After extraction, the manifest must be located exactly here:

```text
{Foundry user data}/Data/modules/pf2e-critical-forge-against-all-odds/module.json
```

The Foundry manifest requires PF2E Critical Forge `1.0.0-rc` or newer. At world start, the extension contract additionally verifies API version, schemas, battlefield-threat support, and all other required capabilities.

## Requirements

- Foundry VTT 14
- Pathfinder Second Edition 8.1.2 or newer
- PF2E Critical Forge `1.0.0-rc` or newer

## Current runtime fields

The add-on extends the Critical Forge snapshot below:

```text
extensions.againstAllOdds
```

It provides dynamic trigger results for:

- `bloodied.matched`
- `surrounded.matched`
- `giantSlayer.matched`
- `narrowEscape.matched`

All values and thresholds are visible through Diagnostics 2.0 and available in the visual Critical Card Editor.

## Compatibility

Against All Odds uses only the public Critical Forge extension contract. It does not patch Critical Forge internals or change Critical Card, Card Pack, Effect, or Diagnostic schemas.

- [`docs/CONTEXT_FIELDS.md`](docs/CONTEXT_FIELDS.md)
- [`docs/CARD_ROADMAP.md`](docs/CARD_ROADMAP.md)
- [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md)

## Current playable cards

Bloodied Triumphs now contains forty cards:

- ten Attack-deck cards, split evenly between ordinary and spell critical hits;
- ten Fortitude-deck cards for critically successful Fortitude saves;
- ten Reflex-deck cards for critically successful Reflex saves;
- ten Will-deck cards for critically successful Will saves;
- thirty-six automated Effect Engine cards;
- four explicit manual cards.

This is the first of three planned ten-card passes per deck. The final Bloodied Triumphs target is 30 cards in each category, or 120 cards in total.

Every card requires `extensions.againstAllOdds.bloodied.matched == true`. Attack cards remain isolated to `attack`; save cards remain isolated to their matching specialized deck and require the corresponding save filter.
